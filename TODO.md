To do:

Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Support pisi packages (http://paketler.pardus.org.tr/pardus-2007/)
* Steal ideas from <http://martin.ankerl.com/files/e>.
* More consistently raise and handle exceptions.

Things that are generally good:
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* shar support.
* --expert mode: prompts don't show an explanation of what the options are,
  unless you ask with ?.
